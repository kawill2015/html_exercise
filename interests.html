 <p>This summer Kate started <a href="http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/special/children/planting-pineapple-tops.htm">growing a pineapple plant </a> in her parents' greenhouse and hopes it survives long enough to produce fruit.</p>
 <p>Kate is addicted to pineapple and buys three to six pineapples at a time when they are on sale at the grocery store.
